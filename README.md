# filtering_process_GW150914

This file constists of two .hdf5 files containing the data strains from the LIGO detectors in Hanford and Livingston, 
one .txt file with the numerical relativity template and a code containing the script used to run the filtering process in my thesis,
"An analysis of the binary black hole merger GW150914".
